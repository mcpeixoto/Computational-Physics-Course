# Computational Physics Course

This repository has all the code that I've used during the Computational Physics Course at UMinho for the Physics Engineering Bachelor's degree at UMinho University 2021/2022.

This includes all the exercises done, all the homework, my final exam and even some condensed content in portuguese about the diferent subjects and methods aproached during the year.

### Final Project

This repository also includes the final report for this class. 

The **Two-stream Plasma instability** was simulated, and it's phase-space evolution plotted using the **Particle in Cell** method. This yielded results in accordance to alternative methods explored in previous papers, particularly using the **Vlasov equation**.
